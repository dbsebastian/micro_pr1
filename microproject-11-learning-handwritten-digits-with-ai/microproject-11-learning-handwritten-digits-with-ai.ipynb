This dataset contains a collection of 70,000 images of hand-written digits and each are labeled with the number (ex: a picture of a \"0\" and labeled as `0`). In this MicroProject, you'll explore the MNIST dataset and learn about various clustering algorithms to help a computer learn to recognize handwritten digits.  Let's nerd out! 🎉\n",
